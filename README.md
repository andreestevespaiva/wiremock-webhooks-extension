# WireMock Webhooks Extension

## THIS REPO IS RETIRED

This project has now been moved under the WireMock project as a core extension, with
enhancements for standalone support, templating and delays.

Please see the [Webhooks and Callbacks](http://wiremock.org/docs/webhooks-and-callbacks/) doc for details.
